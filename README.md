## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

The app can now be started for **development** purposes using

**For Windows:**
```
npm run hc:win
```
**For Other OS:**
```
npm run hc:dev
```
and opening the browser to http://localhost:4141

---
If you would like to persist data between sessions install to the **local holochain directory** by running the following from the project root directory:
```
hcadmin init <id/name string>
hcadmin join ./build-HCHC/ HCHC
hcd HCHC
```
### Prerequisites
Ensure holochain-proto (at least version 26) is installed on your machine by running.

```
hcd -v
```
Subsequent steps also assumes npm/yarn is installed.
